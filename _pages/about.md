A little about me
======
I'm a Mathematics and Electronics student from BITS Pilani University, India. As of now, I'm in my fourth year and find myself particularly inclined towards research in image processing, computer vision, biomedical imaging and numerical analysis. I'm actively looking for opportunities to pursue a research thesis as part of my final year academic requirements.

My decision to pursue mathematics was a simple one. Mathematics is probably one of the most misunderstood sciences, I believe. With people belonging to factions as varied as "Mathematics is the queen of sciences" and "Mathematics has no real application", there's hardly anything that hasn't been said about Mathematics. My personal stance is that, it makes me think, and I'll leave it at that. Pursuing Electrical and Electronics Engineering, simultaneously, my mind has opened up to the blinding number of instances mathematics has made life easier for engineers. It's really hard to understate the impact Mathematics has had on me. 

Additionally, throughout these 4 years, I've also developed a taste for biology, and I can never quite fathom how closely Biology and Math are related. With my own professor and mentor modelling diseases using partial differential equations, and optimization, it is amazing how things have a way of coming together well if we don't waste time thinking about where those things really belong.

My academic interests include
======
* Image Processing 
* Computer Vision
* Virtual Reality
* Augmented Reality
* Digital Signal Processing

I can talk to you endlessly about...
------
* Football. Bleed Blaugrana. Really passionate about the beautiful game. 
* Stand-up comedy. Major league stand-up comedy enthusiast. Let's talk about George Carlin, Jimmy Carr, Bill Hicks and Billy Connolly. 
* Quizzing. No knowledge is ever truly useless, as I've come to believe. 

Still want to know more?
